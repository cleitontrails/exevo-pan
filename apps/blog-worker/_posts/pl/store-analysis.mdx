### Introduction

After we started <SlugLink href="changelog-3">tracking store items</SlugLink>, we had the curiosity to dig deeper into more statistical analysis about the Char Bazaar. This time, we will have a look at **how players spent their Tibia Coins with store purchases üõçÔ∏è**.

Like our previous analysis, these statistics were extracted from our own Char Bazaar historical database. Since our database isn't 100% complete (read the <SlugLink href="about-our-data">explanation</SlugLink>) and since it's not possible to track everything, this analysis is a **lower bound estimate**. It means that, in reality, players have spent much more Tibia Coins than we actually managed to track.

A few factors we could **not** account for:

- Store Consumables: runes, potions, gold converters, teleport scrolls, etc
- Store Utilities: blessings, xp boosts, prey wildcards, name changes, etc

With that being said, let's check out some data! üìö

## Cipsoft revenue from store items

So far, Cipsoft had a revenue of at least <code><TibiaCoin value={148253335} /></code> Tibia Coins from store purchases across all characters from the Char Bazaar.

Compared to their <RouteLink href="/statistics">revenue from bazaar fees</RouteLink>, the Store seems to bring much more cash for Cipsoft. Later in this post we will discuss what are the most popular store purchases.

## Characters with the most Tibia Coins spent

## Differences per region

The list of the top 1,000 spenders is equally distributed among SA, NA and EU regions. But if we look at the average Tibia Coins spent by **all characters** for each region, we can then see some differences:

|    Region     |     Average TC spent      |
| :-----------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Europe     | <TibiaCoin value={591} /> |
| South America | <TibiaCoin value={464} /> |
| North America | <TibiaCoin value={438} /> |

<small align="center">
  Confirming popular belief, players from Europe indeed seem to spend more on
  average
</small>

---

This difference is explained by the fact that approximately `80%` of both NA and SA characters have <code><TibiaCoin value={0} /></code> Tibia Coins spent, while this is a smaller share in EU: `74%` of it's characters.

If we exclude characters that didn't spend at all, then all three regions have the same average of approximately <code><TibiaCoin value={2300} /></code> Tibia Coins spent per character.

### Is Cipsoft trying to target a <em>whale</em> market?

These figures aren't enough to tell if Cipsoft is actually trying to target _whales_. Remember: we are sampling **characters**, not **players**. A player can have multiple characters, so we can't infer the spending profile of a typical Tibia player.

> A "whale" is a player that has a heavy spending habit. Despite being a small proportion of players (around 2%), they can drive the most revenue for a game company.

Still, if compared to other online games, **cosmetics in Tibia are really expensive**. And it gets even worse by the fact that lot of Tibia players are from regions with weak currencies and, consequently, low purchasing power <small>(myself included üòî)</small>. This raises some questions about Tibia store items:

- Should their prices be lowered?
- Should Cipsoft occasionally offer discounts?
- Should store purchases be bound to the account, rather than the character?

In terms of generating revenue, Cipsoft seems to be taking some good decisions lately. Hopefully they might consider some of these suggestions that could benefit not only the players but also the company.

## Differences per PvP type

This won't be a surprise for anyone: Optional PvP servers tend to attract players that spend more. These players purchase more **cosmetics**, while pvp focused players prefer more **boosts and consumables** instead.

Since it's impossible to track all store purchases, take this data with a grain of salt:

| PvP            |     Average TC spent      |
| :------------- | :-----------------------: |
| Optional       | <TibiaCoin value={715} /> |
| Open           | <TibiaCoin value={414} /> |
| Retro Open     | <TibiaCoin value={338} /> |
| Hardcore       | <TibiaCoin value={344} /> |
| Retro Hardcore | <TibiaCoin value={254} /> |

## Most popular store items

Here is the popularity between what we like to call **store utilities**:

Again, no surprises here. **Training dummies** and **prey slots** are the most popular store utilities, even while being the most expensive ones (<code><TibiaCoin value={900} /></code> and <code><TibiaCoin value={750} /></code>, respectively), because they bring an actual advantage for characters.

Almost all the other utilities just give you some extra convenience and they can be easily shared in public between players. This is not the case for **Gold pouch**, **Charm expansion** and **Hunting task slot**. Still, it's highly debatable if those store utilities are actually worth it or not.

## Most popular store cosmetics

Across all characters from the Char Bazaar, `14,7%` of them owned at least one mount or outfit from the Store. These players seem to prefer outfits (`78,7%`) more than mounts (`51,7%`).

Here are the top 10 most popular **store outfits**:
