## Announcement

After the Bosstiary was added to the game, we took the opportunity to add a **new set of filters** to the Char Bazaar. Also, we made it easier for you to share an interesting auction you found on Exevo Pan for your friends using our new **shareable links**. Or maybe you can use it to litter the Adventurer's Guild floor with letters advertising your auction 😛

## Shareable links 

You can now share a link for an auction with your friends! It will refer to the exact `auctionId` of that auction, like so: <a href="https://exevopan.com/?auctionId=972397" target="_blank">exevopan.com/?auctionId=972397</a>.

The Bosstiary was a really cool mechanic added to the game. Since many players are having so much fun with it, we decided to start developing a **Boss Tracker**. You can expect it to be delivered somewhere around October 👾.
