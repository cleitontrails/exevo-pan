## Announcement

Are you not sure about how much to bid on a certain auction? Or perhaps you're curious about your own character value? Our new **Auction Price Calculator** ðŸ“Š now got you covered!

Our algorithm will compare any character auction (or even an hypothetical character) to all similar characters from our auction history database and calculate its average price!

Additionally, you will be able to estimate the auction price for a hypothetical character as well! Just go to our <RouteLink href="/calculators/auction-estimations">Auction Price Estimator</RouteLink> in our calculators section:

## About the calculator

We experimented with several different statistical algorithms and backtested them against our own database to see which one outputted the best results. The overall conclusion was that the price of an auction was strongly correlated with the combination of **server type** and character **level** + **skills**.

Our calculator won't be considering some other valuable aspects, such as:

- Items and equipments
- Mounts and outfits
- Tibia Coin invested
- Charms

Since these characteristics are very **variable** and **subjective**, they end up adding too much noise to our calculations.

Every character is very unique, but our algorithm will perform better when these singularities are ignored. This means that our calculator will point you to an overall baseline value for your character, but it can still vary a lot.
