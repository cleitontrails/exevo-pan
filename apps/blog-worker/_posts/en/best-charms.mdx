### Introduction

Choosing charms is always a tough decision. Since completing bestiaries for charm points is not much of a fun grind, you have to choose wisely how to spend them. If you don't, you might suffer from your bad decisions in the long term.

Every charm is good, but some are more important than the others. This is the case from both a **generalist** and a **niche** perspective.

This article will help you to plan ahead which charms you should be prioritizing ðŸ§™

## Most popular charms overall

| <Charm name="Charm" />            | Popularity |

  These frequencies were analyzed across over 200.000+ characters from our Char
  Bazaar history database. Only characters with at least 1 charm were considered

## Elemental charms

Elemental damage in Tibia isn't completely balanced like _rock paper scissors_. You can argue that some elements are better than others, but the best elements will always be shifting as the meta changes with new updates.

If you're looking for bonus elemental damage, <Charm name="Freeze" /> and <Charm name="Zap" /> are excellent overall choices. This is because _ice_ and _energy_ have been historically good against most relevant creatures. If you are not planning on hunting some specific creatures in the long term, you can't go wrong with them.

Another great pick is <Charm name="Wound" />. Not only _physical damage_ is neutral against most of the game creatures, but this charm is also really **cheap**, costing only `600 points`. The only drawback is that you will be using it mostly for the bonus damage itself, not the bonus elemental damage.

The other charms have more expressive downsides, which explains their lower popularity. They will depend heavily on your vocation (as we will discuss later) and the type of creatures you will be hunting:

- <Charm name="Divine Wrath" /> is amazing, but <code>1500 points</code> is an extremely
  expensive investment
- <Charm name="Enflame" />, <Charm name="Poison" /> and <Charm name="Curse" /> are
  good, but for a smaller set of creatures

## Defensive charms

Arguably the best charm in the game is <Charm name="Dodge" />:

- Super cheap (`600 points`)
- Useful under any circumstance
- Gives your a faster progression

The main point of it is **enabling your character to hunt in harder places earlier**. This charm can really make the difference, especially for lower levels. The only disadvantage is that it's utility scales backwards as your character gets stronger, but later in the game you will have more charm options to use anyway.

<p>
  <Charm name="Parry" /> can be good, but only against creatures that have:
</p>

- **High damage AND low HP** (since it scales with the creature's damage and not with their HP)
- Several **elemental resistances** (because the reflected damage ignores them)

The most classic examples of this are: _Frazzlemaw_, _Dark Torturer_ and _Grimeleech_

## Low Blow

To benefit the most from this charm you **must** be using the _Powerful Strike_ imbuement. Low Blow will then increase your critical hit chance from `10%` to `18%`.

In order to decide if <Charm name="Low Blow" /> is good against a particular creature, you need to compare it's damage against an elemental charm. Since it boils down to a mathematical problem, we prepared a calculator to help you find out which one would be better:

<LowBlowCalculator />

A few other points that you should consider about Low Blow:

- It affects your mana/life leech
- Scales with your character's damage output
- A critical proc will affect all of the other monsters (that you have the Low Blow binded) that were hit

## Utility and passive charms

<p>
  <Charm name="Vampiric Embrace" /> and <Charm name="Void's Call" /> are both
  really expensive, costing <code>1500 points</code> each. Even so, they bring
  very little benefit if compared with other more popular charms. Unless Cipsoft
  buffs their life and mana leech %'s, they should be avoided as noobtraps.
</p>

Still, Cipsoft should be careful about buffing those charms: a slight buff could overtune their numbers and they would then become overpowered for super high level characters.

Underrated by many players, <Charm name="Adrenaline Burst" /> can actually be great in some situations. The speed increase lasts `10 seconds` (twice as long as _utani tempo hur_) and this can help you a lot when moving between boxes in a hunt. Just make sure you use it against creatures that spawns in **low quantities** (like _Frost Flower Asura_ at Asura Palace or _Arachnophobica_ at Winter/Summer courts)

It also can be useful in PvP situations and/or running around dangerous places. <Charm name="Cripple" />, <Charm name="Numb" /> and <Charm name="Cleanse" /> were also supposed to fill this role, but it's hard to recommend these charms to anyone. Their effects are neglectable, to say the least.

Players that are heavily interested in **farming** can make use of <Charm name="Gut" />. Since _skinning_ is an outdated and inconvenient game mechanic, <Charm name="Scavenge" /> is the second least popular charm of all.

The actual least popular charm of all is <Charm name="Bless" />. This one is useless for practically all cases and we don't recommend anyone to use it all.

## General charm progression for each vocation

We crunched down some numbers from or own Char Bazaar database and managed to find a general trend for the order that each vocation acquired their charms:

## What about charms in Rookgaard?

Normally, you wouldn't be able to unlock a charm in Rookgaard. If you completed all the bestiaries available on the island, you would then have only `196 points`, which is not nearly enough.

Still, we found out 26 rookstayers auctioned in the Char Bazaar that had charms unlocked. Those charms were obtained in mainland, and then those characters were sent back to Rookgaard (on purpose or not ðŸ˜›).

- 25 out of those 26 had <Charm name="Adrenaline Burst" />, which seems to give rookstayers the best utility.
- 5 characters had <Charm name="Gut" />, which is used to get minotaur leathers, chicken feathers, etc.

The other charms were mostly elemental charms. The maximum theoretical hit using them in Rookgaard would be `6`, with either _ice_, _earth_ or _death_:

### Reminder

Before we finish, let's just remind you that we didn't cover some other really important aspects such as your **playstyle**:

- Do you focus on loot or XP?
- Are you more safe or aggressive?
- Do you prefer solo or party hunts?

Those should always be factored in before deciding which charm to acquire! All we did here was analyze data from the Char Bazaar and try to figure out some trends and statistics about charms.

We hope this article was helpful and see you next time! ðŸ§™
