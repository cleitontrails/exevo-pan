## Announcement

We are excited to announce one of our most requested features: **tracking store items**!

This means we are now able to filter and display information about <small>(almost)</small> everything that a character can purchase at the store, such as: charm and prey slots, training dummies, outfits, house decorations, and much more 💪

This feature required us to take a step further in **scaling** our project in several dimensions, especially in terms of infrastructure. It was very challenging, but we believe that this was a very important feature to bring even more value to every Tibia player.

Naturally, this also opens up many possibilities for **new filters**. Expect us to add even more of them in the future 😄
