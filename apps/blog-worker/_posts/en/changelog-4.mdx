## Announcement

It's been a while since our last update (exactly 2 months ðŸ˜›), but during this time we have been silently releasing more **performance improvements** for the entire website. We re-wrote all the styles of our project using a more lightweight library. Mobile phone users should have noticed that the website runs faster and smoother overall.

But after that huge refactor was shipped, we started to develop a brand new <RouteLink href="/calculators">Calculators</RouteLink> section! Initially, we are releasing 3 calculators: **Exercise weapons**, **Stamina** and **Charm damage**. Hopefully some of them may be especially useful for the upcoming Double XP/Skill event this week ðŸ˜„

More tools and calculators will be released soon after. We will be listening to the community to figure out which new calculators should be prioritized first.

It's also worth mentioning that we are aware of the new **Bosstiary** feature coming into the game. Depending on its relevance to the Char Bazaar, it might deserve an even higher priority.
