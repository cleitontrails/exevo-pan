## Announcement

From now on we will be offering **progressive discounts** 🛍️ on our <RouteLink href="/highlight-auction">auction advertise</RouteLink> feature!

You get a bigger discount as you select more days to highlight your auction, starting from `17%` up to `33%`.

## About our prices

We love making features that are accessible for everyone (that's why we built Exevo Pan in the first place 💪), but this can't be the case for our <RouteLink href="/highlight-auction">auction highlight service</RouteLink>. We have to tune our prices to curb the demand, so we can avoid scenarios such as:

- Our frontpage having more than 2-3 highlighted auctions
- Low value and/or uninteresting characters being highlighted

Not only this brings a bad user experience, but it also lowers the importance (and value) of the highlight. Right now we believe the service demand is healthy, so we decided to lower the prices a little bit by offering progressive discounts 😄

Changes might happen again in the future, so stay tuned!
