## Announcement

We are proud to announce our new **Blog**, where we will post news about Exevo Pan, interesting articles and useful guides about Tibia! Also, you can now subscribe to our **newsletter** to receive every new content as soon as we publish it 😎.

Are you curious to see what else we are cooking up next? Check our <ExternalLink href="https://trello.com/b/tX6chnl0/exevo-pan">public backlog</ExternalLink>.

## 🎉 Features

- Blog section
- Newsletter
- The frontpage now displays the most recent posts from our Blog
- Scrolling down the frontpage auctions now sticks the grid header to the top of the screen (mobile users ⬆️⬆️)

## 🔧 Refactors

- Bugfix: the frontpage now scrolls properly for iOS Safari users (hopefully)
