## More information about character skills

Last but not least, we combined two awesome suggestions from both <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/xandjiji/exevo-pan/issues/105">mathiasbynens</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TibiaMMO/comments/vsnoy2/comment/if2l1zb/">/u/wakerxane</ExternalLink> to provide even more informations about an auctioned character's skills.
