### Announcement

We are excited to announce **Gem information and filters** and our new **Referral system**!

It's been a while since our last blog post. Since then, we have been silently
(ðŸ¥·) pushing small features and QoL for our boss Hunting Groups and developing
_something epic_, which we will showcase at the end of this post!

## Gem filters

Information about a character's gems will now be displayed in its auction
card. Hovering the element will show which supreme augments the character
owns. If you wish to see the character's complete collection and combinations
of every gem owned, visit its official auction page.

You are also able to filter for **minimum of greater gems amount** and
specific **supreme modifiers** as well.

> Tip: select a specific vocation before filtering for supreme modifiers! Doing
that will make sure that only supreme modifiers available for that vocation
will be shown in the filter options.

## Referral system

Since we started, we have never invested in publicity for Exevo Pan. After some
thought, we realized it would be a good idea to come up with a new avenue
to help other players discover about Exevo Pan. So we created our <RouteLink
href="/dashboard/referrals">Referral System</RouteLink>!

<p><RouteLink href="/exevo-pro"><strong><span
className="rare-gradient-text">Exevo Pro</span></strong></RouteLink> members
will now be able to <strong>earn Tibia Coins sharing discount coupons</strong> with their
friends!</p>

<div className="text-center mx-auto">
<Coupon coupon="GEMS" />
<small style={{fontWeight: 300}}>(This coupon works btw, for a limited time ðŸ‘€)</small>
</div>

We believe this is a organic and healthy way to reach other players, while
creating a budget for members that truly enjoy and recommend using Exevo Pan.
Here is a summary of it:

|  |  |
| :------ | :-------- |
| Exevo Pro discount  | <strong><TibiaCoin value={25} /> / R$ 5,00</strong>   |
| Referral reward  |   <strong><TibiaCoin value={25} /></strong>    |
| Minimum withdraw  |   <strong><TibiaCoin value={0} /></strong>    |

## We are making a game

Yes, you heard that right. For the last 12 months we've been developing a
game! It mixes up elements from **Tibia**, **Teamfight Tactics** and
**Summoners War**, with our own spin on it. Check it out:

It's still very early, but we are already proud to showcase this pre-alpha
version ðŸ˜Ž. There are still a few months of development ahead of us before
shipping anything publicly, but here is what we can tell you so far about the game:

- Runs on your browser (PC/Mobile)
- Casual and chill gameplay
- Online and free-to-play friendly
- Every creature will be **unique**
- Lots of grinding and farming

But that is all for now. Stay tuned, because there is more to come in the
future ðŸ”®
